# Euro2040
 
### An RP2040 based development board designed for use in Eurorack modules

The key aims of this project are to create a board which can be used to create a Eurorack module (or standalone synthesiser) with no need for extra buffering or active circuitry.  
The board will contain internal buffering, amplification, and protection, to allow the GPIO pins to be used with up to 12V signals, allowing users to connect the pins directly to jacks to interface with other Eurorack compliant modules.
